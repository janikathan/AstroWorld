        <h2>Understanding the Influence of Planets Retrograde</h2>
        <p>
            In astrology, planetary alignment is significant in more than one way. First of all, the position of the planets in the sky at the time of your birth reveal significant information about how you see the world, your habits and traits, belief systems, and strengths and weaknesses. Every planet rules over some general domains, giving astrologers insight into the way you function and interact with others. To put it simply, here's what each planet represents:
<pre>
The Sun: Self-awareness & ego
The Moon: Inner emotional life
Mercury: Communication
Mars: Assertiveness & aggression
Venus: Love, beauty & money
Saturn: Responsibility, time & routine
Jupiter: Luck & opportunity
Uranus: Individuality & revolution
Neptune: Dreams, healing, & intuition
Pluto: Sex, death & transformation
Understanding planetary alignment also provides a useful guide for us to understand day-to-day life. As the planets move and orbit in the sky, they shift your focus in different ways. A Jupiter transit through your chart, for example, might bring you surprising opportunities in career, money, or even love. It's important to take notice when a planet is retrograde, or appearing to spin backwards, as it can shed some insight into what's to come. Think of the dreaded Mercury retrograde, when communication goes haywire! Taking note of where the planets are in both your personal astrological chart and in the sky on a regular basis allows you to make sense of events and emotions, and is a powerful tool that can help you allocate your physical and mental resources.
